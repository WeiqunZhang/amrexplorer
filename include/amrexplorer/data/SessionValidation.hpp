// on its own: it does not know how many definitions the request carried. A
// catalog cannot hold more derived fields than fields, cannot report more of
// them than were asked for, and cannot skip a definition that was never sent
// or report more skips than there were definitions -- and a definition cannot
// be both installed and skipped, which is what the counts add up to.
//
// Gathered into one named argument rather than passed as four: fieldCount and
// requestedCount are both counts of the same type, and positionally a caller
// that swapped them would still compile and still satisfy every check on any
// reply whose catalog is larger than its request -- which is every reply that
// installed anything. The siblings above take the request and result objects
// themselves, which is what makes them non-transposable; this one cannot,
// because the reply it checks is a remote:: type and this header does not
// depend on that layer. Naming them does not by itself make leaving one out an
// error: the counts have default initializers, which is what suppresses the
// missing-initializer diagnostic, so an omitted count silently reads as zero
// and passes every check below. Only skips, which has no default, is caught
// that way. What the struct buys is that a swap has to be written down.
