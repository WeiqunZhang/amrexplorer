// pixel, marched front to back through the grid, each sample's value mapped
// through the range to a transfer-function entry whose colour and opacity
// are composited until the ray leaves the grid or turns opaque. Qt-free and
// deterministic: a pixel's result depends only on the inputs, never on how
// the rows are split across threads, so a local and a server render of the
// same request agree pixel for pixel -- for the same build. The compositing
// runs through std::pow and std::log, which no standard requires to be
// correctly rounded, so two libm implementations (or two versions of one)
// can differ by an ulp, and an ulp in a step opacity can compound over a few
// hundred composites into one 8-bit level. Pixel equality across a
// heterogeneous deployment is not a promise this can keep.
